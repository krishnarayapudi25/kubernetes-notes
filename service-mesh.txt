Microservices architectures are heavily network reliant. Service mesh manages network traffic between services.
A service mesh is a mesh of Layer 7 proxies, not a mesh of services. Microservices can use a service mesh to abstract the network away, 
resolving many of the challenges arising from talking to remote endpoints within a Kubernetes cluster. 
Building on Kubernetes allows the service mesh to abstract away how inter-process and service to service communications are handled, 
as containers abstract away the operating system from the application.
