Stateful applications are deployed using statefulsets.

A StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. 
These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.

while we are using "deployment" to manage pods deployment will create or delete pods randomly but while dealing with databases we cant delete or create pods randomly
in such senario we can use statefulsets by using persistant volumes.
