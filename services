###service
each pod has its own ip address when it is destroyed and new one is recreated ip address will change so counter this problem we use sevice which gives a stable ip address
CluserIp:used to communicate within the cluster not outside of cluster...
NodePort:Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port....NodePorts are in the 30000-32767 range by default
LoadBalancer:
Ingress controller:In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an ingress controller running.
                   Kubernetes as a project supports and maintains AWS, GCE, and nginx ingress controllers

Ingress:Ingress makes it easier to use a DNS entry.
        Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster.
        Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

#### Statefulsets
Stateful applications are deployed using statefulsets.

A StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. 
These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.

while we are using "deployment" to manage pods deployment will create or delete pods randomly but while dealing with databases we cant delete or create pods randomly
in such senario we can use statefulsets by using persistant volumes.

### RBAC
Role based access control

it is used to control access the  kcluster by using rbac we can give different level of access or control to different people.
u can give access based on namespace.

### Configmap
A ConfigMap is an API object used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. Pods can consume ConfigMaps as environment variables, command-line arguments, or as configuration files in a volume.

A ConfigMap allows you to decouple environment-specific configuration from your container images, so that your applications are easily portable.
