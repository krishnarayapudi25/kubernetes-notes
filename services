###service
each pod has its own ip address when it is destroyed and new one is recreated ip address will change so counter this problem we use sevice which gives a stable ip address


#### Statefulsets
Stateful applications are deployed using statefulsets.

A StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. 
These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.

while we are using "deployment" to manage pods deployment will create or delete pods randomly but while dealing with databases we cant delete or create pods randomly
in such senario we can use statefulsets by using persistant volumes.

### RBAC
Role based access control

it is used to control access the  kcluster by using rbac we can give different level of access or control to different people.
u can give access based on namespace.
